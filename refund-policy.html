        <h2>Ksoftcode LLC Refund Policy</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
        <br/>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This Refund Policy (the "Policy") governs the terms and conditions under which refunds may be issued by Ksoftcode LLC ("Ksoftcode," "we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing our services, you ("Customer") agree to comply with and be bound by the terms outlined herein. This Policy is intended to ensure clarity and transparency in all refund-related matters.</p>
          <br/>

          <h3>1. Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refunds will only be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
        <h5>1.1 Non-Delivery of Service</h5> <p>If the service purchased has not been delivered or implemented in accordance with the agreed-upon terms between Ksoftcode and the Customer.</p>
        <h5>1.2 Material Defects</h5> <p>If there are significant defects or issues with the delivered service that render it unusable, and Ksoftcode is unable to resolve such defects within a reasonable period after being notified.</p>
        <p>Refunds will not be granted for minor defects or issues that can be reasonably resolved within the scope of ongoing support.</p>
          <br/>

          <h3>2. Requesting a Refund</h3>
          <br/>
        <h5>2.1 Written Request</h5> <p>All refund requests must be submitted in writing to Ksoftcode LLC within thirty (30) days from the date of purchase or service delivery, whichever is applicable.</p>
        <h5>2.2 Required Information</h5> <p>The Customer must provide a clear and detailed explanation for the refund request, including relevant documentation or evidence to support the claim. Failure to provide sufficient information may result in the denial of the refund request.</p>
        <h5>2.3 Submission Method</h5> <p>Refund requests should be sent via email to info@ksoftcode.com or through any other written communication method agreed upon between Ksoftcode and the Customer.</p>
          <br/>


          <h3>3. Refund Review and Processing</h3>
          <br/>
        <h5>3.1 Review Process</h5> <p>Upon receiving the refund request, Ksoftcode will review the claim within a reasonable timeframe. During the review process, Ksoftcode may request additional information or documentation from the Customer to assess the validity of the refund request.</p>
        <h5>3.2 Approval or Denial</h5> <p>Ksoftcode will notify the Customer in writing of the outcome of the refund request. If the refund is approved, it will be processed in accordance with Section 3.3. If denied, the Customer will receive an explanation for the denial.</p>
        <h5>3.3 Processing Timeframe</h5> <p>Approved refunds will be issued to the original payment method within ten (10) business days from the date of approval. Ksoftcode shall not be held responsible for any delays caused by the Customer's financial institution or payment provider.</p>
        <h5>3.4 Partial Refunds</h5> <p>In certain cases, where only a portion of the service was deficient or undelivered, Ksoftcode may issue a partial refund based on the extent of the undelivered or defective service.</p>
          <br/>

          <h3>4. Non-Refundable Services</h3>
        <p>The following services are expressly excluded from any refunds:</p>
<!-- Custome Software Development -->
        <h5>4.1 Custom Software Development</h5><p>Refunds will not be issued for custom software development services once delivery milestones, as agreed between Ksoftcode and the Customer, have been reached. These milestones may include, but are not limited to, project planning, software design, development, coding, testing, and delivery. The Customer acknowledges that each milestone represents a defined stage of progress, and upon acceptance of any milestone deliverable, the Customer forfeits any claim for a refund related to the work completed. Custom software development services are highly individualized to meet the Customer&#x2019;s specific needs, and thus, no refunds will be provided for any portion of the service that has been initiated or completed.</p>
<!-- Cloud Computing Services -->
        <h5>4.2 Cloud Computing Services</h5><p>Refunds are not available for any cloud computing services provided by Ksoftcode LLC once such services have been provisioned or accessed by the Customer. This includes, but is not limited to, services related to cloud infrastructure, hosting, storage solutions, and cloud-based applications. Cloud computing services delivered through third-party platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud are also non-refundable upon provisioning. The Customer acknowledges that upon access to these services, the full cost of the service is incurred, and no refunds will be provided for any unused service or cancellation after the provisioning has occurred.</p>
<!-- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Services -->
        <h5>4.3 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Services</h5><p>Refunds for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services are not permitted once the service has commenced. These services involve complex processes such as data collection, model training, algorithm development, and deployment, all of which require significant time and resource investment. As a result, once work on any AI or ML solution has begun, no refunds will be issued, regardless of whether the final output meets the Customer&#x2019;s expectations or requirements. The Customer acknowledges the experimental and iterative nature of AI and ML solutions and agrees that the services provided are non-refundable.</p>
<!-- CyberSecurity Services -->
        <h5>4.4 Cybersecurity Services</h5><p>Cybersecurity services, including but not limited to penetration testing, security audits, risk assessments, threat detection, and incident response, are non-refundable once such services have been initiated. Given the critical nature of these services and the immediate allocation of resources, Ksoftcode LLC cannot provide refunds after commencement of work. Additionally, consulting and advisory services related to cybersecurity are also non-refundable upon delivery of the advice, findings, or recommendations, regardless of whether the Customer implements or follows the advice provided.</p>
<!-- IOT -->
        <h5>4.5 Internet of Things (IoT) Services</h5><p>Refunds are not available for services related to the Internet of Things (IoT), including but not limited to the development, deployment, integration, and management of IoT devices, platforms, or systems. Once Ksoftcode begins the process of designing or implementing an IoT solution, no refunds will be issued for any portion of the service, even if the project has not yet reached completion. The Customer understands that IoT services involve highly customized solutions requiring significant upfront resource investment and agrees that such services are non-refundable once initiated.</p>
<!-- Consultancy -->
        <h5>4.6 Consulting and Advisory Services</h5><p>Consulting and advisory services provided by Ksoftcode LLC are non-refundable once delivered. This includes, but is not limited to, strategic consultations, technical assessments, professional recommendations, and reports. The Customer acknowledges that the value of consulting and advisory services is derived from the time, expertise, and effort provided by Ksoftcode, and as such, no refunds will be granted once the advice or deliverables have been communicated to the Customer, regardless of the Customer&#x2019;s subsequent use or implementation of the advice.</p>
<!-- Third Part Services -->
        <h5>4.7 Third-Party Services</h5><p>Any services involving third-party platforms or providers, including cloud computing services, software solutions, or integrations provided by third parties, are subject to the refund policies of the respective third-party providers. Ksoftcode LLC will not issue refunds for any third-party services once they have been provisioned or accessed by the Customer. The Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the third-party service provider and understands that Ksoftcode is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, the refund policies or practices of such third parties.</p>
          <br/>

          <h3>5. Modifications to this Policy</h3>
        <p>Ksoftcode LLC reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, amend, or update this Policy at any time, without prior notice to the Customer. Any changes to the Policy will become effective immediately upon being posted to our website, unless otherwise indicated. It is the Customer&#x2019;s responsibility to review this Policy regularly to ensure compliance with any updates.</p>
        <p>In the event of a material change to this Policy, Ksoftcode will notify existing Customers through the contact information provided to Ksoftcode at the time of purchase or through other reasonable means.</p>
        <br/>


          <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>Ksoftcode&#x2019;s liability under this Policy is limited to the refund of the amount paid for the specific service in question. Under no circumstances shall Ksoftcode be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of or related to a refund request, including but not limited to lost profits or business interruptions.</p>
            <br/>

            <h3>7. Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>In the event of any dispute regarding a refund, the Customer agrees to first attempt to resolve the issue directly with Ksoftcode. If a resolution cannot be reached, any disputes arising from or related to this Policy shall be governed by the dispute resolution provisions set forth in the applicable Terms of Service or agreement between the parties.</p>
          <br/>
